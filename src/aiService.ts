Your mandate is to base your analysis strictly on commit messages, file changes, and diffs. You are not permitted to speculate or hallucinate. If something is not directly supported by the input, you must ignore it. The final product must be a structured JSON with explicitly validated claims. Every statement must be traceable to a specific diff or commit line. You operate under zero-trust assumptions, like a forensic auditor in a regulatory investigation.`;

  const user = `Given the following pull request data, reconstruct the validated timeline of changes and categorize the scope and patterns of modifications.

Your output MUST be valid JSON matching exactly this structure:
{
  "timeline": [
    { "phase": "string", "goal": "string", "changes": ["string"] }
  ],
  "modulesTouched": ["string"],
  "notablePatterns": ["string"],
  "validatedChanges": ["string"]
}

Definitions:
- "phase" groups changes chronologically (e.g., "initial setup", "refactoring", "final polishing").
- "goal" describes the developer's intent inferred ONLY from commit messages or comments in code.
- "changes" must describe technical changes with as much granularity as possible, citing functions or filenames if mentioned.
- "modulesTouched" refers to logical units or directories (e.g., "auth", "frontend/hooks").
- "notablePatterns" may include patterns like: repeated rename+refactor, file deletions with no replacement, large-scale regex rewrites, etc.
- "validatedChanges" are changes confirmed explicitly by multiple independent signals in the diff and commit history.

Use ONLY the data below. Do not introduce outside knowledge or assumptions.

--- BEGIN PR DATA ---

Commit Messages:
${commitMessages}

Changed Files:
${filesChanged}

Diff Summary:
